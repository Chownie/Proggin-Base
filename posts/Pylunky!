Pylunky is one of my pet projects. It's a 2D platformer currently undergoing slow redevelopment.

My eventual goal is to have pylunky be a somewhat challenging generated dungeoneering platformer.

Currently it experiences issues with loading resources and in some places suffers from bad design
*(Objects in some cases directly modify one another's attributes instead of requesting it via a function)*

With co-op possibly on the roadmap if I can pick up the skills to design a P2P (or maybe even C2S) system.
