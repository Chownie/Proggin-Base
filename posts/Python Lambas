### How to create a lambda function in Python?

A lambda function is essentially a function that has no name. They are often used as parameters to other functions.

A simple lambda function to square numbers may be created as follows:

```python
# Create a lambda function that takes one parameter and returns it's square
# and assign to the variable f
f = lambda x: x*x
 
assert f(2) == 4
assert f(3) == 9
```

We can also pass lambda functions as function parameters without assigning to to intermediate variables.

```python
# Create a function that takes a function and a list, then applies the function to each element of the list
def map(f, list):
    for i in range(0,len(list)):
        list[i] = f(list[i])
 
# Create a simple test list
list = [1,2,3]
 
# Call our map function passing in a lambda square function and the test list
map( lambda x: x*x, list )
 
assert list[0] == 1
assert list[1] == 4
assert list[2] == 9
```

*Note that lambda functions do **not** include a return statement.*
