1. Introduction 
---------------

4devs is a list of one liners that grew into a group of cookbooks for both
general programming tasks and language specific tasks and solutions.

4alldevs.txt - Examples that apply to programming in any language
4perldevs.txt - Examples gear towards Perl development and tools

The latest version of these files can always be found at:
    http://github.com/kimmel/



2. Requirements
---------------

* Perl 5.10 or newer is recommended however, alternate one-liners are provided
to run on older versions of Perl. Most of the 5.10 examples presented are
shorter than their backwards compatible counterparts.
* Each cookbook has its own requirements section listing any dependencies



3. Reporting bugs
-----------------
Bugs can be reported via the project's Issue queue: https://github.com/kimmel/ /issues . Pull Requests are always welcome.
